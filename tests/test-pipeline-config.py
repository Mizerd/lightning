"""Structural and rule tests for .gitlab-ci.yml.

Proves the pipeline contains the required six-stage graph, that the publish,
verify, and release jobs are gated only on PUBLISH_PACKAGES (so both release
actions include them), that they are correctly wired downstream of validation
and each other, and that a build-only pipeline excludes them entirely.
